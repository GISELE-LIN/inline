## Test Objectives  
- Ensure that users can successfully complete the restaurant reservation process, including selecting the date, time, and number of people.  
- Verify the system's response under different scenarios, such as full bookings, reservation cancellations, and modifications.  
- Ensure that the UI/UX meets expectations and is compatible with different devices and browsers.  
- Ensure that users can successfully complete the ordering process, including selecting menu items, customizing orders, and proceeding to checkout.  
- Verify the system's response to changes in the order, such as modifying item quantities or removing items.  
- Test the systemâ€™s handling of invalid input data in the ordering process, such as incorrect address or payment details.  

## Test Scope  
The test primarily focuses on the Inline reservation systemâ€™s booking and ordering processes, covering the following test areas:

### Functional Testing  
- Booking process (selecting restaurant, date, time, number of people, filling in information)  
- Reservation confirmation and notifications  
- Reservation modification and cancellation  
- Ordering process (selecting menu items, customizing orders, adding items to cart)  
- Order confirmation and notifications  
- Order modification (changing item quantities, removing items)  
- Error handling (invalid input in the ordering process, missing required fields)  

### Performance Testing  
### Security Testing  
### Compatibility Testing  
### Network Testing  
### User Interface Testing  

## Test Environment  
- Test URL: Inline Staging  
- Test Devices:  
- Test Browsers:  
- Test Tools:  

## Test Types  
- **Functional Testing**: Ensure all functions are executed correctly according to requirements.  
- **Performance Testing**: Test the websiteâ€™s load capacity, response time, etc.  
- **Security Testing**: Ensure the system is protected against common attacks like XSS and SQL Injection.  
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure the system works properly across different devices and browsers.  
- **Usability Testing**: Verify the usability of the website to ensure a good user experience.  
- **Network Testing**: Simulate different network environments to ensure system availability.  

## Test Data  
- Valid and invalid contact information (phone numbers, emails)  
- Various combinations of reservation times and group sizes  
- Different menu combinations and shopping cart changes  
- Customizations of menu items (add-ons, side dishes, etc.)  
- Special characters (for SQL Injection and XSS test cases)  
- Different network environments (WiFi, 4G, 3G)  

## Test Priorities  
- **High Priority**: Critical business processes like normal reservations, ordering, order cancellation.  
- **Medium Priority**: Features affecting some user experience, such as order modifications, reservation modifications, and browser compatibility testing.  
- **Low Priority**: UI/UX testing, network testing (impact is limited but still needs attention).  

## Test Criteria  
- **Pass Criteria**: Expected results match actual results, no major defects.  
- **Fail Criteria**: Defects or system errors affecting major functionality.  

This test plan ensures that the Inline test websiteâ€™s reservation and ordering system can run stably under different conditions, reducing risks and improving the user experience. ðŸš€
